# What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is Awesome, go to https://tinytapeout.com for instructions!

## What is this project?

- This design will be submitted on 8th September for fabrication. The name is decidedly overly ambitious, but I will continue to make revisions of this design in future tapeouts until it actually has the features that I want. 

## Plans for the next Tapeout.

- Expand from 1 Tile to 2 Tiles. 
- Enable writing to the character memory and expand the memory to cover the display.
